    "In this practicum you will learn how to implement a basic `React/Typescript` application and bundle it with `Webpack`. `React` is JavaScript library, that is designed to create interactive UIs. This pracitucm covers only the V in MVC. In the next practicum the complete `MVC` implementaion using `React` will be discussed. You will learn how to implement a counter application and manipulate the document object model(DOM). The covered concepts in React are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual DOM.\n",
    "- Javascript XML (JSX).\n",
    "- Components, props and state and events.\n",
    "- Nested elements and component composition.\n",
    "- One-way data flow (parent to child).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 0: Project setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- To setup a React project you need to have `Node.js` installed on your machine (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). \n",
    "\n",
    "- First create a folder for your project and change the path in the command line to it. Then  execute the `npm init` command in order to download node-modules. As a result you will see the `node_module` folder and the `package.json` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm init //confirm the values by pressing enter\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Now you will install `Typescript, React and Webpack` and some other dependecies. Typescript needs React type declarations to do the type checking.  `Webpack` is a tool to automatically build the project and create a package for distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type the following commands in the command line one by one\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm install --save-dev typescript awesome-typescript-loader source-map-loader\n",
    "\n",
    "npm install --save react react-dom  @types/react @types/react-dom\n",
    "\n",
    "npm install -g webpack\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a Typescript config-file in your project folder of your project called `tsconfig.json` and add the following lines to it. \n",

Since this file is already included in `index.html` it will be executed everytime you open/refresh the index.html file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now you will implement the count component in the `components` folder.  Create a file called `count_component.tsx`. Add the following code to it:\n",
