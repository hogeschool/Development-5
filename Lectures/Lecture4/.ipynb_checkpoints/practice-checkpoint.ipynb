    "In this practice you will learn how to setup an MVC application with a template engine. The template engine that we will use is called Razor. Razor is a __markup syntax__ that allows to embed server-based code into web pages by means of C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before showing how to setup such a project we will first take a look at what is HTML. This is necessary to understand the fundamental components that are necessary to build the View entity in our MVC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction to HTML\n",
    "HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a markup language (so it is not a programming langauge) for creting _static_ web pages. Markups are a set of tags that describe how text should be diplayed on a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every HTML page is made by the following items:\n",
    "    - Head, contains info about the webpage\n",
    "    - Body, contains the actual body to display on the screen\n",
    "    - Footer (optional), contains  content to display always on the foot of the page\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "When we run the code above the out on your browser will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"2.JPG\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since pages in HTML are static typical programming elements such as while loops, calling a function, etc. are not found. Reason why to allow dynamism in pages we need expressive tools, such as a programming langauge. The choice of where to simulate such dynamic behavior is currently not trivial, since we are simulating the behavior of distributed applications. The possible options to run code in a html are different and depend on the context.\n",
    "Code could be executed completely on the browser (client side), completely on the server, or a trade-off. Today we will see the second option, that is how to run code on the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve this, we will use Razor together with ASP.net. In Razor a template file, which is made of a mix of literal text (a sort of HTML), is mixed up with C# statements (not all C# statements are allowed [1]). When all required data for a view are available the template engine will take care of embedding this data into the template and send the resulting page to the client. The page comes in the shape of a HTML page that can be interpreted by a common browser. ___In a template file Razor syntax starts with the __@__ sign. This sign will be used to automatically start parsing a statement by the engine, otherwise the HTML code will be directly pushed without any further processing.   ___\n",

    "#### Setting up an MVC application with Razor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we see some example on how to use Razor in a basic web application. In the end we will see how to use present our Movie model with Razor in an MVC application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Simple \"datetime\" view in Razor\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a basic razor project call the command `dotnet new razor` and then `dotnet restore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the code of this sample remove first the content of the _Index.cshtml_ file present in the _Pages_ folder and ad to it the following code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@page\n",
    "@using razorapp\n",
    "@model IndexModel\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Hello World</h1>\n",
    "<h3>\n",
    "    @Model.Message\n",
    "</h3>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above the statement _@page_ converts the file into an MVC action, which means that it handles requests directly, without going through a controller. \n",
    "In addition when the index page is loaded a __Hello World__ message is presented with an additional message that comes from the model (_@Model.Message_). The message comes from the model which is defined in the file called _Index.cshtml.cs_. In this file we will define the shape of our model and how to access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will add a value to the message to print on the screen together with the _Hello World_ message. More precisely, we will print the current time. Open the file _Index.cshtml.cs_ and copy the following code.\n",
