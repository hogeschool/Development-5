    "This document guides you through the steps necessary to create your first model and to connect it to a simple application. As discussed in the theory lesson models are fundamental to have a structured image of your data in the database. Later the model will be re-used in a more sophisticated solution where users will be able to access and interact with it via browser. We will get there soon, but first let's start from the basics.\n",

    "# Step 0: .NET Core\n",
    "- Install the .NET Core SDK from https://www.microsoft.com/net/core.\n",
    "- As IDE we recommend Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/download. Remember, if you decide to install this IDE, then use the extentions manager tool to install the C# interpreter, which will enhance the overall experience of your IDE when programming in C#. C# will be used throughout all this course.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The Entity Framework enables you to query, insert, update, and delete data, by manipulating common language runtime (CLR) objects known as entities (or POCOs). Given a model (which is written in C#) the EF maps its entities and relationships into an actual database. In this example we chose as database Postgres. The EF provides facilities to interact with the records in the database as if they are .Net objects (in our case C# objects). Moreover, EF solves typical challenges found in the DB realm such as concurrency, persistence of the data (between the .Net objects and the database records), etc.\n",
