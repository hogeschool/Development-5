q5: Given a context class that defines a relationship between two entities Movie and Actor, what 
is the result of executing the OnModelCreating-method:
...
 protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            modelBuilder.Entity<MovieActor>()
                .HasKey(ma => new { ma.MovieId, ma.ActorId });

            modelBuilder.Entity<MovieActor>()
                .HasOne(m => m.Movie)
                .WithMany(r => r.MovieActors)
                .HasForeignKey(m => m.MovieId);

            modelBuilder.Entity<MovieActor>()
                .HasOne(a => a.Actor)
                .WithMany(r => r.MovieActors)
                .HasForeignKey(a => a.ActorId);
        }
...

- A N-to-N relationship between the entities Movie and Actor. It will create three tables in the database. *
- A One-to-N relationship. It will create two tables in the database.
- A N-to-N relationship. It will create two tables in the database.
- A One-to-N relationship. It will create three tables in the database.

----------------------------
q6: EF can resolve an One-to-N relationship just by following the provided classes' structure: 
-Yes, if the foreign key is unique
-Yes if you follow the conventions *
-No
-Yes, if the migration scripts are setup correctly
----------------------------
q7: An entity X is related to an entity Y through a foreign key (One-to-N). What happens to Y if X is deleted, when using LINQ in combination with Postgres? 
-Error
-Both X and Y are deleted *
-Nothing changes
-The foreign key is set to NULL in Y

----------------------------
q8: In the context of EF, given the following code using(var db = new MyContext()){...body...} what is the purpose of keyword using? 
-To avoid the database to get erased
-It starts the tracking of entities
-Nothing, it is just a syntactic sugar

...
 protected override void OnConfiguring (DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder) {
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlite ("Data Source=Movie.db");
        }
 ...

-It connects the current Context to a database called "Data Source=Movie.db"
-It connects the current Context to an Sqlite database *
-It gives a compilation error
-It connects the current Context to a Postgres database
----------------------------
q10: What is the result of executing the following code in the method OnModelCreating?
...
modelBuilder.Entity<Actor> ()
            .HasOne(m => m.Movie)
            .WithMany (a => a.Actors)
            .HasForeignKey (m => m.MovieId);
...

-An N-to-N relationship from Movie to Actor is established
-A One-to-N relationship from Movie to Actor with MovieId as foreign key in Actor is created *
-A One-to-One relationship from Movie to Actor is established
-A One-to-N relationship from Movie to Actor with ActorId as foreign key in Movie is created
----------------------------
q11: In EF given a One-to-N relationship between Movies and Actors, what is the behaviour of the following code?

foreach(var m in db.Movies){
    Console.WriteLine(m.Title);

    foreach(var a in m.Actors){
       Console.WriteLine(a.Name); 
    }
}
...

-Prints for every movie its actors
-Runtime error since Actors is always null *
-Prints all the actors in the database
-Runtime error since m is null
----------------------------
q12: In EF given a One-to-N relationship between Movies and Actors. Assuming the relationships are correctly implemented. what is the behaviour of the following code?

foreach(var m in db.Movies){
    Console.WriteLine(m.Title);
    foreach(var a in db.Actors.Where(a => a.id == m.actor_id )){    
       Console.WriteLine(a.Name); 
    }
}
...
